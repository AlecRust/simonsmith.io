Alongside [re-developing QMetric’s corporate website](http://simonsmith.io/project/qmetric/ "QMetric") my other main project was to lead a re-build of the Policy Expert website. It used a completely new design (sourced externally) developed with a mobile first responsive approach and used WordPress to power the content.

We chose to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org), HTML5 elements and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) as the main technologies and implemented as much of [the SMACSS approach](http://smacss.com/) as possible. This led to some really nice re-use of modules across the various pages. The site uses a fluid layout and uses media queries to tweak content positioning at various screen sizes.

One of the early challenges was to construct the navigation in a way that made it easy to use on phones as well as desktop. The primary navigation was definitely one of the tricker modules to build but I feel it works really nicely regardless of device size.

Many responsive sites tend to remove content on smaller devices but I’m pleased with the way that the Policy Expert site doesn’t make assumptions about what you should see.

I left the company about halfway through development but it’s good to see it finally finished and looking as great as I imagined.
