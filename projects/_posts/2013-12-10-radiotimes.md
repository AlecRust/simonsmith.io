Working on the re-build of the Radio Times website has been one of my more rewarding projects. Assuming a lead UI developer role has allowed me to select numerous modern techniques that are not often seen on a BBC branded site.

The new site uses a slice of HTML5, plenty of CSS3 and also MooTools to handle the JavaScript demands. Being in a small team adhering to tight deadlines has meant working closely with other developers and learning a great deal about building such a vast site.

One part of the site I am particularly pleased with is the new TV and Radio listings page. It is a fully Ajax driven application that leverageâ€™s the power of the MooTools Class system to create some really neat and concise code. It even works acceptably without JavaScript!
