One of my main projects on the Top Gear site was a complete re-build of the home page, as well as implementing a new global header and footer onto all other sections. I worked [with another UI developer](http://www.alecrust.com/) to completely architect the front-end code from scratch.

With a site that receive such a vast amount of traffic we had to be very considerate to performance. A lot of effort went into minifiying code, compressing images and re-factoring under-performing JavaScript. I also worked closely with other back-end developers to improve other sections of the site.

Thankfully Clarkson and the other TG boys gave it a big thumbs up!

As well as this project I was also responsible for maintaining the Top Gear WordPress blogs, which largely involved integrating new design features.
