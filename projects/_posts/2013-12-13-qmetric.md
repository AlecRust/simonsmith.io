The QMetric site was originally designed and built by an external agency. However, due to the lack of responsive design and out of date front-end practices I took upon myself to re-build the single page site in my spare time.

Approaching the re-build with mobile first&nbsp;responsive&nbsp;design was a given, particularly as QMetric focus on using the latest development practices and techniques. Although there was already a design for the site it only existed as a desktop version so some of the tough choices were around how the site would look and function on smaller devices.

I made heavy use of [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) on this project, not only for the ease of code organisation but also to conditionally load assets based on the device size. Loading the Google Map was only done on larger devices for example. This helped a lot with performance and usability.

Despite it being a single page website, I found it useful to break the LESS files up into components and employ as many [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) features as possible.

The source of the site [is also viewable on GitHub](https://github.com/qmetric/qmg-website).
